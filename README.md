# [php_srrJSEncrypt](https://github.com/caos30/php_srrJSEncrypt)

Simple way (unique PHP file) to store your encrypted data in a single text file, not using database at all and encrypting from the client side using javascript AES algorithms

## Start the project

Copy this project in any PHP 5 server and call it from browser. Default encryption key "1234". Each time you decrypt, you can change key and re-encrypt and save. 
You must remember that the encryption key is not saved ANYWHERE, so you must take care by yourself for not forget it!

## Use, improve and share

You're welcome to use it. I use it since long time ago for save all my important private data, hosting a copy of this project on one of my servers. 
Please, if you make any improvement, request a pull ;)
